Summer 2024 Internship at Bytewise
This summer, I had the incredible opportunity to be selected as a Bytewise Fellow for the 2024 Summer Internship. During this time, I focused on full-stack development, primarily utilizing the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).

What I Worked On:
Developed scalable web applications using the MERN stack.
Implemented features on both the frontend and backend, working with RESTful APIs and databases.
Gained hands-on experience with React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB, solving real-world problems.
Collaborated with other developers and learned best practices for agile development and code optimization.
Skills & Technologies:
Frontend: React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+)
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, REST APIs
Database: MongoDB, Mongoose
Version Control: Git & GitHub
This experience has greatly enhanced my full-stack development skills, and I look forward to leveraging this knowledge in future projects!
